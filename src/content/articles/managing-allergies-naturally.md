# Managing Allergies Naturally

Nasal allergies affect millions worldwide, but you don't always need to rely solely on medications. Discover natural remedies and lifestyle modifications that can help you breathe easier.

## When Natural Remedies Aren't Enough

Consult an ENT specialist if:

## Tracking Your Progress

Keep an allergy diary:
