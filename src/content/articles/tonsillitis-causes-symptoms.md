# Tonsillitis: Causes, Symptoms & When to Seek ENT Care in Uganda

Tonsillitis is one of the most common throat conditions we treat at Eritage ENT Care in Entebbe. Whether you're a parent worried about your child's recurring sore throats or an adult experiencing painful swallowing, understanding tonsillitis helps you know when home care is enough—and when professional ENT evaluation is essential.

## What Is Tonsillitis?

Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils—the two oval-shaped tissue pads at the back of your throat. Your tonsils are part of your immune system, helping fight infections. When overwhelmed by bacteria or viruses, they become swollen, painful, and sometimes covered with white or yellow patches.

### Types of Tonsillitis:

| Type | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Acute Tonsillitis** | 3-14 days | Single episode, usually resolves with treatment |
| **Recurrent Tonsillitis** | Multiple episodes/year | 5-7+ episodes per year requiring evaluation |
| **Chronic Tonsillitis** | Ongoing | Persistent infection lasting months |
| **Peritonsillar Abscess** | Emergency | Pus collection beside the tonsil (Quinsy) |

## Common Causes of Tonsillitis

### Viral Infections (Most Common - 70%)

Most tonsillitis cases in Uganda are caused by viruses:

- **Adenovirus** – Common cold virus
- **Epstein-Barr virus** – Causes infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever)
- **Influenza virus** – Seasonal flu
- **Parainfluenza virus** – Respiratory infections
- **Enteroviruses** – Various throat infections

### Bacterial Infections (30%)

When bacteria cause tonsillitis, treatment differs significantly:

- **Group A Streptococcus (Strep throat)** – Most common bacterial cause
- **Staphylococcus aureus** – Can cause severe infections
- **Streptococcus pneumoniae** – Especially in immunocompromised patients
- **Haemophilus influenzae** – More common in children

**Important:** Bacterial tonsillitis requires antibiotics to prevent complications like rheumatic fever—a condition still prevalent in Uganda.

## Recognizing Tonsillitis Symptoms

### Primary Symptoms:

**What you'll notice first:**

- Sore throat (often severe)
- Pain when swallowing (odynophagia)
- Red, swollen tonsils
- White or yellow coating on tonsils
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
- Fever (mild to high)
- Bad breath (halitosis)

### Symptoms in Children:

Children may show different signs:

- Refusal to eat or drink
- Excessive drooling
- Unusual fussiness or irritability
- Stomach pain or vomiting
- Voice changes or muffled speech
- Difficulty breathing during sleep (snoring)

### Symptoms Suggesting Bacterial Infection:

These signs suggest strep throat requiring antibiotics:

- High fever (above 38.5°C/101°F)
- **No cough** (viral infections usually include cough)
- Swollen, tender neck glands
- White patches or pus on tonsils
- Sudden onset of severe symptoms
- Petechiae (tiny red spots) on the palate

## Home Care for Mild Tonsillitis

### DO: Supportive Measures

**Hydration is key:**
- Drink plenty of warm fluids (tea with honey, warm water)
- Avoid very hot or acidic drinks
- Ice chips or cold water can soothe pain
- Oral rehydration salts if feverish

**Pain and fever relief:**
- Paracetamol (as directed for age/weight)
- Ibuprofen for inflammation (if no contraindications)
- Warm salt water gargles (½ teaspoon salt in warm water)
- Throat lozenges for adults and older children

**Rest and comfort:**
- Complete rest—tonsillitis is exhausting
- Soft, easy-to-swallow foods (porridge, mashed bananas, soup)
- Humidify the air if possible
- Avoid smoke and dust exposure

### DON'T: Common Mistakes

❌ **Don't give aspirin to children** – Risk of Reye's syndrome

❌ **Don't stop antibiotics early** – Incomplete courses cause resistance

❌ **Don't force hard foods** – Increases pain and trauma

❌ **Don't ignore dehydration** – Especially dangerous in children

❌ **Don't share utensils** – Tonsillitis is contagious

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is tonsillitis contagious?

**Yes.** Both viral and bacterial tonsillitis spread through:

- Sharing food, drinks, or utensils

Keep infected individuals away from others, especially for the first 24-48 hours of treatment.

### Can adults get tonsillitis?

**Absolutely.** While more common in children, adults can get tonsillitis. Adult tonsillitis can be more severe and may indicate underlying health issues requiring evaluation.

### How long does tonsillitis last?

- **Viral tonsillitis:** 7-10 days with supportive care
- **Bacterial tonsillitis:** Improves within 24-48 hours of starting antibiotics
- **Chronic tonsillitis:** May persist for weeks without proper treatment

### Do I need antibiotics for every sore throat?

**No.** Most sore throats are viral and don't need antibiotics. However, bacterial tonsillitis (strep throat) requires antibiotics to prevent complications. An ENT specialist can determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
