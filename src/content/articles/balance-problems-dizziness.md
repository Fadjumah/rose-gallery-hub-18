## Understanding Balance Problems and Dizziness

Balance problems and frequent dizziness are among the most common complaints we encounter at our ENT clinic in Entebbe. These symptoms can significantly impact your quality of life, affecting your ability to work, drive, and perform daily activities safely.

The inner ear plays a crucial role in maintaining balance. When something disrupts the delicate balance mechanisms in your ear, you may experience vertigo (a spinning sensation), unsteadiness, lightheadedness, or a feeling of floating.

## What is Meniere's Disease?

Meniere's disease is a chronic inner ear disorder that affects hearing and balance. It typically affects one ear and can occur at any age, though it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60.

### Classic Symptoms of Meniere's Disease

1. **Vertigo Episodes**: Sudden, severe spinning sensations that can last from 20 minutes to several hours
2. **Hearing Loss**: Fluctuating hearing loss that may become permanent over time
3. **Tinnitus**: Ringing, buzzing, roaring, or whistling sounds in the affected ear
4. **Ear Fullness**: A feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear (aural fullness)

### What Causes Meniere's Disease?

The exact cause remains unknown, but it's believed to be related to abnormal fluid buildup (endolymph) in the inner ear. Contributing factors may include:

- Viral infections
- Autoimmune reactions
- Allergies
- Genetic predisposition
- Head trauma
- Migraines

## Other Common Causes of Dizziness in Uganda

### Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)

BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. It occurs when tiny calcium crystals in your inner ear become dislodged and move into the ear canals. Symptoms include:

- Brief episodes of dizziness triggered by head movements
- Nausea and vomiting
- Unsteadiness

**Good news**: BPPV can often be treated successfully with simple repositioning maneuvers performed in our clinic.

### Vestibular Neuritis and Labyrinthitis

These are inner ear infections that cause inflammation and can result in:

- Sudden, severe vertigo
- Nausea and vomiting
- Difficulty with balance
- Hearing loss (in labyrinthitis)

### Ear Infections

Middle ear infections (otitis media) are particularly common in Uganda and can affect balance, especially in children.

3. **Remove Hazards**: Clear walkways of obstacles and loose rugs
4. **Use Handrails**: Install handrails in bathrooms and stairways
5. **Sit Down**: When feeling dizzy, sit or lie down immediately
6. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day
7. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: These can worsen symptoms

### Diet Recommendations for Meniere's Disease

- Reduce salt intake to less than 2,000mg per day
